Category on GoFundMe - do we need that? --Andrew covered

Alternative login features such as Facebook or Google? -MVC OAuth

Kickstarter has a countdown for "live" campaigns - I think that's a good idea

Do we want them to be able to connect with facebook or any other social media?

Kickstarter has an option for "number of days" or "end on date and time" - I think that's a good idea. --Andrew covered

Kickstarter campaigns only get funded if the goal is met, should we do something like this? - Personally I feel like its a hassel

Kickstarter has a rules page, would we accomplish that same thing by the terms of use or should we do something similar? - I ask because of the multi-state platform this will end up being.

I feel like both kickstarter and gofundme both dont cover a whole lot of information. I know personally I dont like filling in a bunch of information that is seemingly useless just to fill out more information when my project or charity profile gets approved. - I think we should account for all possibilities on the campaign page and leave it at that.

Indiegogo does a percentage decrease when you go to start a funding campaign for charity, that's a good idea. If you're funding a project their percentage is 5%, if its a charity the percentage is 3%.

Indiegogo has levels based on amounts of donations - We could do brackets of percentages for the winners to push donors to give more.

Indiegogo also does a preview before the users campaign starts - I like that idea.

Rockethub only does funding for legal companies and will only allow their campaign manager to set a goal of over 100K.

Razoo does fundraising teams which I think is cool.

Razoo's UI looks modern and clean but kind of busy.

Crowdrise is part of gofundme - their UI's are different, but the idea is pretty much similar.

Pledgemusic is specifically for music, but the platform is kind of the same, a bit more intensive on the campaign aspect.
